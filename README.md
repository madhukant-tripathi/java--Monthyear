# Month and Year Calendar Program

This is a simple Java program made by me.
It shows the calendar of any month and year.

## What this program does
- Takes month and year as input
- Finds the correct starting day
- Prints the calendar
- Works correctly for leap year

## What I used
- Loops
- If-else
- Arrays
- Basic math logic

## Why I made this
I wanted to know how a calendar is made.
This program helped me understand dates and logic.

## How to run
- Compile the program
- Run it
- Enter month and year

I made this program myself for practice.
